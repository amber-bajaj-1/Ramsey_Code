# Ramsey_Code
Computes theoretical applications of Ramsey Theory to solve coloured linear equations, find long monotone sublists, and highlight monochromatic copies of subgraphs within large multi-coloured networks

This project was created under the mentorship of Tonatiuh Matos Wiederhold from the University of Toronto, and was presented at the 2023 Canadian Undergraduate Mathematics Conference.
